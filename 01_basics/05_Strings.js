const name = "Ritik";
const score = 100;

console.log(name + score + " best");  // This is string concatenation method but we dont use this nowdays bcz this is little older version.

console.log(`Hello my name is ${name} and my score is ${score} and im the best`); //This method is known as String Interpolation , in which we create the placeholder and we can assign value in them.
