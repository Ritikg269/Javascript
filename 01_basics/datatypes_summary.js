/*Javascript => JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning that type checking is done at runtime, rather than during compilation.
Some other languages that use dynamic typing include Python and Ruby. 


Basically JS divided 2 category of datatypes.
1 - Primitive data 
2- Non-primitive data

=> Primitive datatypes (call by value)- 7 datatypes are primitive
String, Number, Boolean , Null , Undefined, Symbol, BigINt



=> Reference or Non-primitive datatypes (call by reference 
Array, Object and Functions)

Return type of variables in JavaScript
1) Primitive Datatypes
       Number => number
       String  => string
       Boolean  => boolean
       null  => object
       undefined  =>  undefined
       Symbol  =>  symbol
       BigInt  =>  bigint

2) Non-primitive Datatypes
       Arrays  =>  object
       Function  => function object
       Object  =>  object
